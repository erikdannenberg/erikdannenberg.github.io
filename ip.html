                <h1> IP Addresses and DNS</h1>
<p> In the 1970â€™s, there was no way for networks to communicate. This issue was solved by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn who
    invented the Internet Working Protocol. This protocol laid the groundwork for what we think of the Internet today.
    In order for a new device to use the Internet, it just needs to know what protocol to follow. </p>

<p> All devices on the Internet have unique address, which are a set of numbers. In order for things on the Internet to
    get where they need to go, they need to follow the Internet Protocol (IP). All devices connected to the internet
    have what is called an IP address. IP addresses are a string of numbers, represented by bits. Traditional IP address
    are 32 bits long, 8 bits for each part of the address. IP addresses are broken into country/network ->
    region/network -> subnetwork -> device. This became known as IPv4.</p>

<p> IPv4 came about in 1973. It provided more than 4 billion unique addresses. But that proved to not be enough.
    We are currently transitioning to IPv6 which will take several years. This IP provides 340 undecillion unique
    address.</p>

<p>When a computer wants to get to a website, it goes through what is known as a Domain Name System, or DNS. Computers
    only know a sites name but a DNS can provide the IP address. DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy,
    broken up into zones like .com and .org. </p>
