                <h1>HTTP and HTML</h1>

                <p>When you want to get to a website, you start by opening up a web browser. Options of web browsers
                    include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. When you type a URL, Uniform Resource
                    Locator, into your web browser. Your computer then reaches out to a server, which can be thousands
                    of miles away, and asks for the website. This all happens in just milliseconds. The server talks
                    back to your computer in a language called HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is used to
                    communicate between web browsers and servers. The “conversations” our computers have with servers
                    are with get requests. Get requests are made up of the word GET, followed by the name of the
                    document you are trying to get. This tells the sever you want the HTML code of whatever it is you
                    are trying to load. </p>
                <p>HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the language used to tell a webpage how you want to to look.
                    Text of a webpage is included in HTML files, but other things like images and videos are separate.
                    Get requests are sent out of each picture and video and they are displayed as they arrive to the
                    site. </p>
                <p>When you are submitting information on a website, filling out a form or searching for something, a
                    post request is being created. Websites are able to remember who you are using cookies. </p>
                <p>Since the Internet is open to anyone, that leaves personal information at risk of getting into the
                    wrong hands. Luckily, with the usage of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security
                    (TLS), there is a layer of security wrapped around your communications and information. You know
                    these security measures are in place when you see a little lock icon next to the website URL in
                    your browser. When a website wants to establish a secure connection with a browser, it provides a
                    digital certificate, this proves that the website is what it claims to be. These certificates are
                    given by trusted entities that verify identities of websites. </p>
