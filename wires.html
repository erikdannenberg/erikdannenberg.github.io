                    <p>The Internet is a system designed to move information from one place to another. It is a way to
                        send information made of bits which are sets of 1’s and 0’s. This is known as binary code.
                        8 bits together is 1 byte, 1000 bytes is 1 kilo byte, and 1000 kilo bytes is 1 mega byte (a
                        typical song is about 3-4 mega bytes). No matter what you are sending, everything on the
                        Internet is sent around as bits. Bits can be sent in three different ways- with electricity,
                        light, or radio waves.</p>

                    <p>Using electricity, bits are sent per a certain amount of time. The speed at which the bits are
                        sent are a result of something called bandwidth. Bandwidth is transmission capacity, measured by
                        bitrate. Bitrate is the number of bits per second a system can transmit. This can also be known
                        as latency, which is the time it takes for a bit to travel from a sender to a receiver. The
                        major benefit of using electricity is that it is relatively cheap but its downside is there is
                        a lot of signal loss.</p>

                    <p>Light takes advantage of fiber optic cables. These cables, on the inside, are coated with a
                        reflective surface that allows the light to travel through without any interruption. Fiber optic
                        cables are so reliable they can travel across oceans. They are also one of the fastest, if not
                        the fastest, way to send information from one place to another. The only downside is that that
                        are super expensive to install and set up, and they are not the easiest to work with.</p>

                    <p>Sending information via radio uses radio signals. The machines that transmit the signal have to
                        change the 1’s and 0’s to radio wave frequencies. Then, the receiving machines have to change
                        those radio frequencies back to the binary code. Not having any wires can be a great thing, it
                        is one less thing you have to manage. However, it comes with signal lass. Wireless connections
                        can only reach so far and if you step out of range, you will lose service. </p>

                    <p> The image below is an easy to digest way of looking at this topic. Wireless vs Wired
                        connections. Both have their advantages and disadvantages so there is no clear winner to which
                    is better. It depends on what you need.</p>
