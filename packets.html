                <h1>Packets, Routing and Reliability</h1>
                <p> Data does not travel through the Internet as a direct connection. It travels in a less direct
                    fashion. Information on the Internet goes from one computer to another in something that is called
                    a packet. A packet travels similarly to how we might drive from one location to another. You are
                    able to send many kinds of information using these packets, however there is a limit. If something
                    is too big to send, it needs to be broken down into smaller packets and then “reconstructed” when
                    it gets to its final destination. Each packet is sent out with the Internet address of where is it
                    coming from and where it is going. Routers are used to make sure packets travel smoothly. When
                    packets of information are traveling, the most direct route is normally not the fastest. Computer
                    look for the “cheapest” route, or the most time effective to get packets where they need to be.</p>

                <p> With having different routes packets can take to get to a destination, this makes the network fault
                    tolerant. This means the network can continue to send packets even if something goes wrong.
                    This goes hand in hand with a key principle of the Internet known as reliability. </p>

                <p> Now how do you know that all of the information you are trying to get is going to be delivered?
                    Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, manages the sending and receiving of all data as packets.
                    When packets arrive to your computer from a sender, TCP makes sure all of the packets were
                    delivered. If TCP notices something is missing, it will not “sign” for the packets and the sender
                    will have to resend what is missing.</p>

                     <p> <b>Example:</b> This webpage you are viewing got to this point by being sent across the Internet
                         as smaller pieces. Those packets may have taken different routes to get here, since they look
                         for the fastest, but they still made it.
                    </p>
